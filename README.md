# Sigmos
### The best graphing calc no doubt in the whole wide world.

## Purpose:

This tuff ahh calculator was made because I felt like Desmos was simply too weak
so of course I had to create Sigmos, the obviously better version. Hence, the name, a combination of Sigma and Desmos.


## Features:

For now, it can do any linear equations, and MOST non-linear equations.
The most obvious equations it is unable to solve are ones that result in non-continuous lines.
For example, getting the tangent of x or y, results in a heart rate monitor
instead of the weird curvy thing you would usually get.
